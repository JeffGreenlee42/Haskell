Exercise 1.2. Add parentheses to the following expressions to indicate the order in which Haskell’s precedence and associativity rules would evaluate the expressions: 
(a) 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 
2^(3^4)

(b) 2 / 3 / 4 
(2 / 3) / 4 

(c) 7 - 5 / 4
7 - (5 / 4) 

(d) log 49/7
logBase 2 49 / 7 

Answers: 
 (a) 2 ^ (3 ^ 4)
  (b) (2 / 3) / 4
  (c) 7 - (5 / 4)
  (d) (log 49) / 7

  Exercise 1.3. Use GHCi to find log2 32.

  logBase 2 32
  
  Exercise 1.4. Use the atan2 function in GHCi to find the polar coordinates (r,θ) associated with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) = (–3,4).
  atan2 (-3) 4


  Exercise 1.5. Find a new example of a calculation in which the computer produces a result that is just a little bit different from the exact result. 

  Exercise 1.6. Why is there no associativity listed for the equality, inequality, and comparison operators in Table 1-2? 
  (Hint: write down the simplest expression you can think of that would 
  require the associativity rules to resolve the precedence of comparison operators and try to make sense of it.)
